// Description:
// You've been collecting change all day, and it's starting to pile up in your pocket, but you're too lazy to see how much you've found.

// Good thing you can code!

// Complete the function to return a dollar amount of how much change you have!

// Valid types of change include:

// penny: 0.01
// nickel: 0.05
// dime: 0.10
// quarter: 0.25
// dollar: 1.00
// These amounts are already preloaded as floats into the CHANGE object for you to use!

// You should return the total in the format $x.xx.

// Examples:

// "nickel penny dime dollar" --> "$1.16"
// "dollar dollar quarter dime dime" --> "$2.45"
// "penny" --> "$0.01"
// "dime" --> "$0.10"
// Warning, some change may amount to over $10.00!
