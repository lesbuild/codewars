// Description:
// The notorious Captain Schneider has given you a very straightforward mission. Any data that comes through the system make sure that only non-special characters see the light of day.

// Create a function that given a string, retains only the letters A-Z (upper and lowercase), 0-9 digits, and whitespace characters. Also, returns "Not a string!" if the entry type is not a string.
