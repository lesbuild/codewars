function Counter() {
  let counter = 0
  this.check = function(){return counter};
  this.increment = function(){return counter++};
}
// Description:
// Code as fast as you can!

// You need to make a constructor function with two methods (and only these two methods) to return and increment a counter, but the counter should not be directly accessible from outside the function.
